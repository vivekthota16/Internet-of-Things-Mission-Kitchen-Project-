# Internet-of-Things-Mission-Kitchen-Project-
The most common problem faced by the working professionals and students is how to cook the food items efficiently which means that cooking the food healthier and not wasting much resources. As an initiative of Swatch Bharat we should not waste the food and resources. At first, our solution will be able to display the user with all the available food items present in the kitchen along with their quantities on applications. It also takes care of giving text based suggestions to the user on the food items he can cook with the available quantities and also to how many persons the specific food item can be cooked. Next, the user will get predictions on when the raw food items are supposed to get finished. Our solution also gives the amount of gas left and estimation on completion of gas. It can also give safety measures by automatically turning off the stoves.
